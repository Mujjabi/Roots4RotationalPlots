# Root Data Analysis - Organic Rotational Plots
The objective of this repository is to analyse the root and agronomic data obtained from the rotational plots from 2022 and 2023 growing seasons. The 2021 data set is different given that we tested a different set of hybrids and were grown in strip-plots of 4 rows wide and 65 feet long. Some of the hybrids in the 4 year rotation were different from the 3 year rotation (check the dataset). 

Therefore, the focus will be put on the 2022 and 2023 dataset since a similar set of hybrids was tested in both years using the same experimental design and plot arrangement (RCBD using split-split plots). In this experiment, the **2 rotation systems** (3 and 4 year rotations) are the main plots, **3 nitrogen treatments** (N1, N2 and N3) are the small plots and **15 hybrids** (NREC hybrids, UIUC Expvps, Organic hybrids and commercial organic checks) as the split-split / sub-sub plots. 

Each rotation system is replicated 4 times, resulting to a total of **360 plots** per year (2 rot x 4 reps x 3 Nitro x 15 hybrids/Nitro). However for the root data, only N1 and N3 were sampled in 2022. In 2023, treatments in some of the replications were eliminated given to equipment operational errors that occurred during the spread of the chicken manure.

The analysis will be conducted separately for each year.
